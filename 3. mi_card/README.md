# Mi Card

## Goal

After completing i_am_rich & i_am_poor as basic projects, going further and learn more about how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps.

## What I created

Mi Card is a personal business card. Imagine every time you wanted to give someone your contact details or your business card but you didn't have it on you. Well, now you can get them to download your business card as an app.

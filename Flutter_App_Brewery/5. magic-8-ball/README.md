# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Goal

The objective of this challenge is to solidify what you've learn't in the Dicee tutorial. This app will guide you through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and you will be applying what you have learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I created

I made a magical 8 ball app, it will give you the answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.
